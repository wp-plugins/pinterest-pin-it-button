== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**The "Pin It" button is showing up, but clicking it does nothing. What can I try?**

To the best of our knowledge, in order please try the following:

* Make sure your browser cache is cleared or test in a different browser.
* Make sure any WordPress caching is emptied. In W3 Total Cache, make sure Minify mode is set to Manual, not Auto.
* Disable caching plugins.
* Disable other social sharing plugins.
* Disable other plugins one by one until the issue is fixed. If you find an incompatible plugin please let us know.
* (More solutions added here as they're found.)

**How do I display the button in places other than above or below the content?**

* Use the shortcode `[pinit]` to display the button within content.
* Use the function `<?php echo do_shortcode('[pinit]'); ?>` to display within template or theme files.

**How do I get the "Pin It" button to line up next to my other social sharing icons?**

* Add custom CSS on the settings screen and optionally remove the surrounding `<div>` tag.
* See some of our [custom CSS examples](http://pinterestplugin.com/pin-it-button-custom-css).

**I'd like to report a bug or submit a feature request.**
